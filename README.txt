This is a compilation of Project Euler problems and some solutions for them. All problems that
can be found in the program have correct solutions already implemented in Python 3.

While I originally solved all Project Euler problems in this repository on my own, I did draw
some inspiration from the Project Euler forums on problems where my solution was relatively slow.
However, even though a few solutions were based on another individuals solution, all code was
created exclusively by me (nothing was copied).

I did not keep track of which solutions were created entirely by me and which solutions drew
inspiration from the forums. In addition, I'm fairly confident that every single solution I
came up with exists on the forums already. Because of this, I'm just going to say that this
program is simply a compilation of relatively fast solutions from the Project Euler forums and
none of the solutions belong to me. There, now I should be safe from millions of dollars in
copyright lawsuits that will undoubtedly start appearing when this repository takes the world
by storm.

When running ProjectEulerDriver.py, there is a text-based menu that can be used to navigate
through the completed solutions. Alternatively, if there is a specific problem you would like to
solve, you can pass the problem number into the program as command line arguments. The program
will print the solutions for each problem in the command line and then exit.
