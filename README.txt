This is a compilation of problems and my solutions for them. All problems that can be found in the
program have been successfully solved, and the solutions (coded in python) are included. 

All solutions were created by me, with the exception of problems 1-4. Although I originally solved
problems 1-4 on my own, I decided early on that, after initially solving the problem, I wanted to do
some research in order to make sure I made my solution as efficient as possible. I soon decided 
(after problem 4) that I was more interested in solving the problems themselves over finding the 
mathematically optimal solution.

For all problems 5 or above, I created a solution that was solved in less than 1 minute and then
moved onto the next one. The "1-minute Rule" that Project Euler outlines ensures that I don't 
purely bruteforce each problem, but I don't have to spend extra hours or days searching for the
most efficient solution.

When running ProjectEulerDriver.py, there is a text-based menu that can be used to navigate through
the completed solutions. Alternatively, if there is a specific problem you would like to solve, you
can pass the problem number into the program as command line arguments. The program will print the
solutions for each problem in the command line and then exit.
